## About Me

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Software Engineering at the [School of Software, Tsinghua University](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), working with my insightful/talented/kind/lovely advisor [Prof. Jiliang Wang](http://tns.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jiliang/). 
I received my Master's (2023) from Tsinghua University and my Bachelor's (2020) from Central South University.
I am a mediocre (for now) but devoted (knowing everything is a huge burden for me) researcher on wireless networks.

## Research Interests

- **Wireless:** Localization
- **IoT:** Backscatter communication/sensing

## News

- **[Mar. 2023]** Our paper about backscatter localization is accepted to [Mobisys 2023](https://www.sigmobile.org/mobisys/2023/).
- **[Sep. 2022]** I am admitted to Tsinghua University as a PhD student, still working with my rockstar advisor [Prof. Jiliang Wang](http://tns.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jiliang/).
- **[Aug. 2021]** Our paper about backscatter communication is accepted to [Mobicom 2021](https://www.sigmobile.org/mobicom/2021/index.html).
- **[Sep. 2019]** I am admitted to Tsinghua University as a master student, working with [Prof. Jiliang Wang](http://tns.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jiliang/).
